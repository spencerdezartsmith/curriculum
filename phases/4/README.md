# Phase 4

## Description

The software field -- and indeed, the world at large -- owes a great deal to the open source software community. Like most developers, members of Learners Guild benefit daily from the availability of countless freely available software tools and educational resources. We are committed to contributing to these efforts and resources as committers to (and even maintainers of) open source projects.

In the **apprenticeship** phase, SEPs and learners will collaborate on contributions to OSS projects and possibly on live, production systems like the LOS apps (echo, idm, etc.). SEPs will select projects and work with learners to identify appropriate issues to work on, and learners will be expected to submit pull requests to project maintainers.

## High Level Skills

In this phase you will learnâ€¦

- How to "look under the hood" and understand how larger applications and systems work
- How to be a good contributor: understand OSS (open source software) best practices
- Adapting to the style and conventions of an existing codebase
- Advanced git and GitHub (e.g. complex branching strategies)
- How to develop elegant, maintainable solutions to complex problems
- DevOps for live production deployments
- More advanced debugging and problem-solving skills
- How to collaborate on a team and use basic project-management tools

## Projects

SEPs will choose the projects to be worked on. These may be internally-developed tools, or external projects.

Some examples of projects you may work on:

- Ghost: https://github.com/tryghost/ghost
- Free Code Camp: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp
- React Toolbox: https://github.com/react-toolbox/react-toolbox
- LOS: echo, idm, curriculum

Work is selected by SEPs and tracked via the [Phase 4 Trello board][trello]. Join this board and the `#phase-4` Slack channel.

## Support

In phase 4, learners can expect to be working closely with an SEP throughout the week. In the course of working on an open issue (either a bug fix, feature, or chore), SEPs will support learners in one or more of the following ways:

- Reviewing learners' code thoroughly, offering suggestions and feedback
- Doing live code reviews for all learners to observe and particpate in
- Providing guidance and assistance in problem solving via Slack
- Personally explaining concepts via Slack, video calls, and/or ad hoc whiteboarding sessions
- Demonstrating advanced problem solving
- Sharing resources for solo study

When a learner has a set of changes ready to be submitted to the project maintainers as a pull request, SEPs will also provide live and/or asynchronous code reviews as needed.

## Tracking

As with phases 1, 2, and 5, weekly (cycle-based) project tracking for learners in phase 4 will happen automatically in the background. The assigned goal will be a generic Phase 4 goal. These projects will have retro surveys, and learners will be expected to set a project artifact.
